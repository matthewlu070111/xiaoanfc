### üôã FAQ
1. **Can I pull requests?**<br>
   Of course, pull a request whenever you want to, and if it really does benefit then it will be merged!
2. **Can I make submods?**<br>
   Of course, but make sure to use CC0-1.0 as the licence of your mod.
3. **Can I contain your mod(s) in my modpack?**<br>
   Do it if you want, you don't have to grant permissions!
4. **Can I port your mod(s) into (Neo)Forge?**<br>
   To be honest, you can join me if you want to make a Forge mod, the reason why I didn't make a Forge version is that I have no time to make it.
